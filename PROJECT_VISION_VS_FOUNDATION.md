# Project Vision vs Foundation Tasks Comparison

## Executive Summary

**Project Vision** (`openspec/project.md`):
- Full-featured construction Work OS with RFIs, submittals, change orders, daily reports
- Offline-first PWA with IndexedDB sync
- AI copilots embedded throughout
- Drawing management with 250MB PDF support
- QuickBooks/Sage integrations
- **12-week MVP timeline** with all core workflows

**Foundation Tasks** (`add-project-foundation/tasks.md`):
- **99 tasks** covering ONLY infrastructure
- Authentication, multi-tenancy, base UI
- **ZERO construction-specific features**
- **ZERO offline capability**
- **ZERO AI integration**
- **ZERO file handling**

**The Gap**: Vision describes a fully-featured product. Foundation builds infrastructure only.

- Tablet-optimized: 10" iPads and Android tablets

### Performance Requirements
- Offline sync: Resume uploads from interruptions, queue 100+ pending mutations
- Photo compression: Reduce 12MP photos to <500KB for sync efficiency
```

#### **Foundation Tasks Say:**

```markdown
## 8. Base UI Components (shadcn/ui)
- [ ] 8.1 Initialize shadcn/ui
- [ ] 8.2 Add components: button, input, label, form...

- QuickBooks Online API - Financial export
- Sage 100/300 adapters - Accounting integration
- Email-in/out - RFI/submittal email workflows
- OIDC/SAML - SSO for Pro/Enterprise tiers

### AI Copilots
- Smart routing (assign RFIs to right person)
- Compliance checks (submittal vs spec requirements)
- Risk prediction (identify potential delays)

### Budget & Timeline
Weeks 11-12: AI v1 (RFI routing, spec Q&A, submittal compliance), SSO
```

#### **Foundation Tasks Say:**

**NO tasks for:**
- ‚ùå OpenAI API integration
- ‚ùå AI copilot infrastructure

- React-PDF (PDF.js workers) - Large PDF rendering (100MB+)
- Konva or Fabric.js - Canvas-based drawing markups and annotations
- TanStack Table - Virtualized tables for large datasets

### Performance Requirements
- Large file handling: PDFs up to 250MB, drawings with 100+ sheets
- Drawing load time: <2s on mid-range tablet for 50MB PDF

### Drawings/Specs
- 100+ MB PDFs
- Version control critical
- Hyperlinked sheets
- On-plan markups
```

#### **Foundation Tasks Say:**

### 5. COST CODES & DOMAIN DATA

#### **Project Vision Says:**

```markdown
### Cost Code Structure (CSI MasterFormat)
- Division 01-14: General Requirements ‚Üí Conveying Equipment
- Division 21-28: Fire Suppression ‚Üí Electronic Safety & Security
- Division 31-33: Earthwork ‚Üí Utilities
- Example: 03 30 00 (Cast-in-Place Concrete) ‚Üí 03 30 53 (Concrete Topping)

### Data Modeling Principles
- Cost codes: CSI MasterFormat hierarchy (division ‚Üí section ‚Üí item)
- Status enums: Use Postgres ENUMs for finite state machines
  (RFI status, submittal status)
- Version control: version column + history tables for documents
```

#### **Foundation Tasks Say:**

```markdown
## 3. Database Schema & Migrations
- [ ] 3.7 Create Postgres ENUMs: org_role, project_role
```

## Timeline Comparison

### **Project Vision Timeline** (from project.md):

```markdown
### Budget & Timeline
12-week MVP: Core workflows + offline sync + AI v1

Weeks 1-2: Repo setup, Supabase, auth/tenancy, base entities
Weeks 3-4: File pipeline (TUS + Uppy), PDF viewer, photo capture
Weeks 5-6: RFIs v1 (email-in, numbering, SLA timers), Submittals v1

```

### **Foundation Tasks Timeline** (reality):

```markdown
Actual scope: ONLY Weeks 1-2

‚úÖ Weeks 1-2 COMPLETE:
- Repo setup ‚úì
- Supabase ‚úì
- Auth/tenancy ‚úì
- Base entities (orgs, projects) ‚úì

‚ùå Weeks 3-12 NOT STARTED:
- File pipeline
- PDF viewer
- RFIs
- Submittals
- Daily Reports
- Punch Lists
- Change Orders
- AIA Billing
- QuickBooks
- AI copilots
- SSO
```

**Completion status**: **17% complete** (2/12 weeks)

---

## What This Means

### ‚úÖ **Foundation is Solid**

The "Weeks 1-2" work is **production-ready**:
- Multi-tenant architecture ‚úì
- Row-Level Security ‚úì
- Audit logging ‚úì
- Authentication flows ‚úì
- Base UI components ‚úì
- Testing infrastructure ‚úì
- CI/CD pipeline ‚úì

**This was absolutely the right foundation to build.**

### ‚ùå **Features are 0%**

The remaining "Weeks 3-12" work is **100% outstanding**:
- 0% of RFI functionality
- 0% of Submittal functionality
- 0% of Change Order functionality
- 0% of Daily Report functionality
- 0% of Offline sync
- 0% of Drawing management
- 0% of AI integration
- 0% of QuickBooks integration

### üìä **The Reality**

**If the project vision is the destination:**
- You've built the foundation (Weeks 1-2) ‚úì
- You have 10 more weeks of work remaining (Weeks 3-12)
- **Estimated timeline**: 2.5-3 months to MVP
- **Estimated effort**: ~500-600 hours of development

---

## Recommendation

### **Option 1: Stick to Vision Timeline**

**Build all 12 weeks as planned:**
- Weeks 3-4: File/PDF infrastructure
- Weeks 5-6: RFIs + Submittals
- Weeks 7-8: Daily Reports + Punch Lists
- Weeks 9-10: Change Orders + QuickBooks
- Weeks 11-12: AI + SSO

**Pros:**
- Delivers complete vision
- All core workflows functional
- Strong market differentiation

**Cons:**
- 2.5-3 months until ANY features ship
- High burn rate with no revenue
- Risk of building features nobody wants

### **Option 2: MVP-First Approach** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

**Ship incrementally:**

**Phase 1 (Weeks 3-6): RFI Module ONLY**
- Tables: `rfis`, `rfi_responses`, `rfi_attachments`
- UI: Create, list, detail, respond
- Logic: Ball-in-court, SLA timers, email notifications
- **Ship to 5-10 beta customers**

**Phase 2 (Weeks 7-10): Add Submittals**
- Tables: `submittals`, `submittal_reviews`
- UI: Multi-stage approval workflow
- Logic: CSI tracking, status workflow
- **Expand to 50 beta customers**

**Phase 3 (Weeks 11-14): Add Change Orders + Offline**
- Change order workflow
- IndexedDB + sync engine
- **General availability**

**Pros:**
- Revenue after 4-6 weeks (RFI-only beta)
- Validate pricing model early
- Iterate based on real feedback
- Lower risk

**Cons:**
- Less differentiation initially
- Can't market "complete solution"

### **Option 3: Ultra-Lean MVP**

**Ship RFI module ONLY (no offline, no AI):**
- Focus on web-only experience
- Manual email integration (no AI routing)
- Prove product-market fit first
- Add offline + AI after validation

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks to first beta

## Honest Assessment

### **Your Vision is Excellent**

The `openspec/project.md` correctly describes:
- ‚úÖ Market need (construction-native vs monday.com)
- ‚úÖ Technical architecture (offline-first, PWA, AI)
- ‚úÖ Domain expertise (CSI MasterFormat, AIA billing, RFI workflows)
- ‚úÖ Competitive differentiation (gloves-friendly, field-first)

### **Your Foundation is Excellent**

The `add-project-foundation` correctly prioritizes:
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenancy architecture
- ‚úÖ Security first (RLS, audit logs)
- ‚úÖ Scalable patterns
- ‚úÖ Testing infrastructure

### **The Gap is Understandable**

- Vision = "What should exist" (12-week full product)
- Foundation = "What must exist first" (2-week infrastructure)
- Gap = 10 weeks of construction-specific features

**This gap is NORMAL and EXPECTED.**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Your MVP Scope**
   - Full 12-week vision?
   - RFI-only 4-week MVP?
   - RFI + Submittals 6-week MVP?

2. **Create OpenSpec Proposals**
   - `/openspec:proposal` for RFI module
   - Break down into database + UI + logic + tests

3. **Set Realistic Timeline**
   - 4 weeks for RFI-only
   - 8 weeks for RFI + Submittals
   - 12 weeks for full MVP

4. **Communicate Honestly**
   - Show roadmap to stakeholders
   - Set expectations for beta vs GA
   - Be clear about what EXISTS vs what's PLANNED

## Summary

| Aspect | Vision (project.md) | Foundation (tasks.md) | Status |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Scope** | Full construction Work OS | Infrastructure only | 17% complete (2/12 weeks) |
| **Timeline** | 12 weeks to MVP | 2 weeks completed | 10 weeks remaining |
| **Features** | 8 core workflows | 0 workflows | 100% gap |
| **Offline** | Critical requirement | Not started | 100% gap |
| **AI** | Core differentiator | Not started | 100% gap |
| **Integrations** | QuickBooks, Sage, Email | Not started | 100% gap |
| **Infrastructure** | Multi-tenant, RLS, Auth | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | 0% gap |

**Bottom Line:**
- ‚úÖ Foundation is production-ready (2/12 weeks done)
- ‚ùå Features are 0% complete (10/12 weeks remaining)
- üìã Gap is 2.5-3 months of focused development
- üéØ Recommend MVP-first: Ship RFI module in 4 weeks, validate, iterate
