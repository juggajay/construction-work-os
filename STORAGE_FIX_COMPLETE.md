# Storage RLS Policies Restoration - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Summary

Supabase support successfully fixed the storage schema issue, but dropped RLS policies in the process. We have now **fully restored all storage RLS policies** and verified they are working correctly.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Storage Schema ‚úÖ (Fixed by Supabase Support)
Supabase support updated the `storage.buckets` table schema to include all required columns:
- `public` (boolean)
- `file_size_limit` (bigint)
- `allowed_mime_types` (text[])
- `avif_autodetection` (boolean)

**Verification:** Storage Dashboard now loads without errors ‚úÖ

### 2. Storage RLS Policies ‚úÖ (Restored by Us)
When Supabase support updated the `storage.foldername()` function, they had to drop dependent RLS policies with CASCADE. We restored **all 10 policies** across 3 buckets:

#### Project Invoices Bucket (3 policies)
- ‚úÖ Users can upload invoices to accessible projects (INSERT)
- ‚úÖ Users can view invoices from accessible projects (SELECT)
- ‚úÖ Managers and supervisors can delete invoices (DELETE)

#### Project Quotes Bucket (4 policies)
- ‚úÖ Managers and supervisors can upload quotes to accessible projects (INSERT)
- ‚úÖ Users can view quotes from accessible projects (SELECT)
- ‚úÖ Managers and supervisors can update quotes (UPDATE)
- ‚úÖ Managers can delete quotes from their projects (DELETE)

#### Daily Report Photos Bucket (3 policies)
- ‚úÖ Users can upload daily report photos (INSERT)
- ‚úÖ Users can view daily report photos (SELECT)
- ‚úÖ Users can delete daily report photos (DELETE)

**Verification:** All policies confirmed in Supabase Dashboard > Storage > Policies ‚úÖ

---

## How We Fixed It

### Step 1: Identified Affected Migrations
Found 3 migration files containing storage RLS policies:
- `20250122000021_create_storage_bucket_daily_reports.sql`
- `20251028032730_create_project_quotes_storage_bucket.sql`
- `20251030000003_fix_storage_invoices_rls.sql`

### Step 2: Created Restoration Script
Created `scripts/restore-storage-rls-policies.js` to re-apply the migrations via Supabase Management API.

### Step 3: Applied Migrations
```bash
node scripts/restore-storage-rls-policies.js
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ All 3 migrations applied successfully

### Step 4: Verified Restoration
Created `scripts/verify-storage-rls-policies.js` to query the remote database and confirm all policies exist.

```bash
node scripts/verify-storage-rls-policies.js
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ All 10 policies confirmed present in production database

### Step 5: Verified in Dashboard
Manually checked Supabase Dashboard:
- ‚úÖ Storage buckets page loads without errors
- ‚úÖ All 5 storage buckets visible
- ‚úÖ Policies page shows all 10 restored policies

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Supabase Dashboard Tests
| Test | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Storage buckets page loads | ‚úÖ PASS | No "Failed to fetch buckets" error |
| All buckets visible | ‚úÖ PASS | 5 buckets displayed (submittals, change-orders, invoices, quotes, daily-reports) |
| Storage policies page loads | ‚úÖ PASS | All 10 policies displayed correctly |
| Bucket schema correct | ‚úÖ PASS | All required columns present (public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types) |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend Invoice Upload Test
**Status:** BLOCKED by unrelated local development error

**Error:** Next.js runtime error in `DashboardMobileLayout`:
```
TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'parallelRouterKey' of 'param' as it is null.
```

**Note:** This is a **separate issue** unrelated to the storage RLS fix. The storage backend is fully operational. The frontend error needs to be addressed separately.

## Files Created

1. **`scripts/restore-storage-rls-policies.js`**
   - Re-applies storage RLS migrations to remote database
   - Uses Management API to execute SQL
   - Includes all 3 storage RLS migrations

2. **`scripts/verify-storage-rls-policies.js`**
   - Queries remote database to verify policies exist
   - Displays bucket and policy information
   - Provides summary of expected vs actual policies

3. **`STORAGE_FIX_COMPLETE.md`** (this file)
   - Documents the complete fix process
   - Verification results
   - Next steps

---

## Next Steps

### ‚úÖ Storage Fix: COMPLETE
The storage RLS policies are fully restored and verified. Invoice uploads, quote uploads, and daily report photo uploads should now work correctly from a **storage/database perspective**.

### üîß Frontend Issue: Needs Attention
There is a **separate** Next.js runtime error blocking local development:
- **Error:** `TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'parallelRouterKey' of 'param' as it is null`
- **Location:** `components/mobile/dashboard-mobile-layout.tsx`
- **Impact:** Prevents app from rendering in local development
- **Recommended Action:** Deploy `/frontend-developer` or `/debugger` agent to fix this Next.js routing issue

### üìã Recommended Testing (Once Frontend Fixed)
1. Log into application
2. Navigate to a project's budget/costs page
3. Upload an invoice PDF
4. Verify file uploads to `project-invoices` bucket
5. Verify file is accessible and downloadable

## Technical Details

### Remote Database Connection
- **Project Reference:** `tokjmeqjvexnmtampyjm`
- **Project Name:** monday
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 (Supabase)
- **Method:** Management API (direct SQL execution)

### Storage Architecture
All storage buckets use folder-based organization:
```
bucket-name/
  {project_id}/
    {file_id}/
      {filename}
```

RLS policies check project access using:
- `storage.foldername(name)[1]` to extract project_id from path
- `project_access` table for role-based permissions
- `organization_members` table as fallback for org-level access

---

## Support Communication

**Initial Issue:** Storage schema missing columns (reported to Supabase support)

**Support Response:** Schema fixed, but policies dropped with CASCADE when updating `storage.foldername()` function

**Our Resolution:** Restored all policies via Management API, verified complete

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - No further support action needed

---

## Conclusion

**Storage RLS Fix: 100% Complete ‚úÖ**

All storage buckets are operational, all RLS policies are in place, and the Supabase Storage Dashboard is fully functional. The invoice upload feature is ready to use from a backend perspective.

The Next.js frontend error is a separate issue that needs to be addressed by a frontend specialist.
