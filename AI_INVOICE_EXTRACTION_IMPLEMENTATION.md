**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implementation Complete - Ready for Manual Testing
**Agent**: Database Specialist (via Orchestrator)

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. **lib/utils/parse-invoice.ts** - Enhanced AI Response
- ‚úÖ Added `confidence` score calculation (0-1 range)
- ‚úÖ Added `rawResponse` storage for audit trail
- ‚úÖ Confidence decreases based on missing/default fields:
  - Missing vendor: -0.2
  - Missing invoice number: -0.15
  - Missing/invalid date: -0.15
  - Missing/zero amount: -0.3
  - Missing description: -0.1
  - No line items: -0.1

#### 2. **lib/actions/invoices/upload-invoice.ts** - Accept AI Metadata
- ‚úÖ Extract `aiParsed`, `aiConfidence`, `aiRawResponse` from FormData
- ‚úÖ Save to database instead of hardcoding `ai_parsed: false`
- ‚úÖ Added logging for AI metadata

**Before:**
```typescript
ai_parsed: false, // Manual entry for now
```

**After:**
```typescript
ai_parsed: aiParsed,
ai_confidence: aiConfidence,
ai_raw_response: aiRawResponse,
```

#### 3. **components/costs/upload-invoice-form.tsx** - Pass AI Metadata
- ‚úÖ Store AI metadata (`confidence`, `rawResponse`) when parsing succeeds
- ‚úÖ Pass metadata via FormData when uploading invoice
- ‚úÖ Only sends AI metadata if parsing succeeded

---

## üîÑ Complete Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User uploads PDF/image invoice**
   - File input accepts: `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.heic`
   - Max file size: 25MB

2. **AI automatically extracts data** (via OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API)
   - Vendor name
   - Invoice number
   - Invoice date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Total amount
   - Description
   - Line items (optional)

3. **Form fields auto-populate**
   - User sees extracted data
   - Toast notification: "Invoice Parsed! AI successfully extracted invoice data."
   - Blue banner shows: "AI extracted this data. Please review and edit if needed."
   - Sparkle icon ‚ú® indicates AI-parsed data

4. **User reviews and confirms**
   - Can edit any field
   - Selects budget category (Labor, Materials, Equipment, Other)
   - Clicks "Upload Invoice"

5. **Invoice saved to database**
   - File uploaded to Supabase Storage (`project-invoices` bucket)
   - Database record created with:
     - `ai_parsed: true`
     - `ai_confidence: 0.85` (example score)
     - `ai_raw_response: {...}` (full OpenAI response)
     - `status: 'pending'` (requires approval)

6. **Budget allocation updates automatically**
   - When invoice is **approved**, materialized view refreshes via trigger
   - `project_cost_summary` shows updated spending
   - Budget allocation deducts from selected category

## üìä Database Schema

### project_invoices Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE project_invoices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id UUID NOT NULL,
  budget_category project_budget_category NOT NULL, -- 'labor', 'materials', 'equipment', 'other'

  -- File storage
  file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
  mime_type TEXT NOT NULL,

  -- Invoice details (AI-parsed or manual)
  vendor_name TEXT,
  invoice_number TEXT,
  invoice_date DATE,
  amount DECIMAL(15, 2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,

  -- ‚úÖ AI metadata (NOW POPULATED!)
  ai_parsed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ai_confidence DECIMAL(3, 2),  -- 0.00 to 1.00
  ai_raw_response JSONB,         -- Full OpenAI response

  -- Approval workflow
  status invoice_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'paid'
  approved_by UUID,
  approved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

  uploaded_by UUID NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Budget Tracking (Already Exists)
```sql
-- Materialized view that auto-calculates spending
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW project_cost_summary AS
SELECT
  p.id AS project_id,
  b.category,
  b.allocated_amount,
  COALESCE(spent.amount, 0) AS spent_amount,
  b.allocated_amount - COALESCE(spent.amount, 0) AS remaining_amount
FROM projects p
JOIN project_budgets b ON p.id = b.project_id
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT project_id, budget_category, SUM(amount) AS amount
  FROM project_invoices
  WHERE status = 'approved' AND deleted_at IS NULL  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only approved invoices count!
  GROUP BY project_id, budget_category
) spent ON p.id = spent.project_id AND b.category = spent.budget_category;

-- Trigger auto-refreshes view when invoices change
CREATE TRIGGER refresh_cost_summary_on_invoice
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON project_invoices
FOR EACH STATEMENT EXECUTE FUNCTION refresh_cost_summary();
```

## üß™ Manual Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
1. ‚úÖ Development server running: `npm run dev`
2. ‚úÖ Local Supabase running: `npm run db:start`
3. ‚úÖ OpenAI API key configured in `.env.local`

### Test Steps

#### 1. Navigate to Upload Invoice Page
```
http://localhost:3000/ryox-carpentry/projects/d59e59fc-4ee6-469d-ac28-8be421ccdd0b/costs/upload-invoice
```

#### 2. Upload Test Invoice
- Use PDF file: `C:\Users\jayso\Downloads\construction_invoice.pdf`
- Contains:
  - Vendor: Premium Construction Pty Ltd
  - Invoice #: INV-2025-001
  - Date: October 25, 2025
  - Amount: $11,000.00
  - Description: Residential Construction - Test Project

#### 3. Verify AI Extraction
‚úÖ **Expected behavior:**
- Loading spinner appears
- After 5-10 seconds, toast notification: "Invoice Parsed!"
- Form fields auto-populate:
  - Vendor Name: "Premium Construction Pty Ltd"
  - Invoice Number: "INV-2025-001"
  - Invoice Date: "2025-10-25"
  - Amount: "$11000"
  - Description: "Residential Construction - Test Project"
- Blue banner: "AI extracted this data. Please review and edit if needed."
- Sparkle icon ‚ú® next to file name

#### 4. Select Category and Submit
- Select Category: **Labor** (or Materials/Equipment/Other)
- Click "Upload Invoice"

#### 5. Verify Database Record
```bash
npm run db:psql -- -c "SELECT id, vendor_name, invoice_number, amount, ai_parsed, ai_confidence, status FROM project_invoices ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
```

‚úÖ **Expected output:**
```
                  id                  |      vendor_name          | invoice_number | amount   | ai_parsed | ai_confidence | status
--------------------------------------+---------------------------+----------------+----------+-----------+---------------+---------
 <uuid>                               | Premium Construction ...  | INV-2025-001   | 11000.00 | t         | 0.85          | pending
```

#### 6. Approve Invoice (to update budget)
```bash
npm run db:psql -- -c "UPDATE project_invoices SET status = 'approved', approved_by = (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1), approved_at = now() WHERE id = '<invoice_id>';"
```

#### 7. Verify Budget Allocation Updated
```bash
npm run db:psql -- -c "SELECT * FROM project_cost_summary WHERE project_id = 'd59e59fc-4ee6-469d-ac28-8be421ccdd0b';"
```

‚úÖ **Expected output:**
- `spent_amount` increases by $11,000 for Labor category
- `remaining_amount` decreases by $11,000

## üîç Verification Checklist

### AI Extraction
- [ ] PDF upload triggers AI parsing automatically
- [ ] Loading spinner shows during parsing
- [ ] Toast notification appears on success
- [ ] Form fields populate with extracted data
- [ ] Blue "AI extracted" banner displays
- [ ] Sparkle icon ‚ú® appears

- [ ] After approval ‚Üí status = 'approved'
- [ ] Materialized view refreshes automatically (via trigger)
- [ ] `project_cost_summary.spent_amount` increases
- [ ] `project_cost_summary.remaining_amount` decreases
- [ ] Budget tracking dashboard shows updated values

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI extraction doesn't start
**Symptoms**: No loading spinner, fields don't populate
**Cause**: File onChange event not firing
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify OpenAI API key is set: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY` (should start with `sk-proj-`)
3. Check network tab for 500 errors on `/api/` routes

### Issue: "Failed to parse invoice"
**Symptoms**: Error toast appears
**Causes**:
1. OpenAI API key missing/invalid
2. File type not supported (must be PDF, JPG, PNG, HEIC)
3. File size > 25MB
4. OpenAI API timeout/error

**Solution**:
1. Check `.env.local` has `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...`
2. Verify file type and size
3. Check OpenAI API status

### Issue: Budget doesn't update
**Symptoms**: Invoice uploaded but spending doesn't change
**Cause**: Invoice status is still 'pending'
**Solution**: Only **approved** invoices count toward budget. Approve invoice first:
```sql
UPDATE project_invoices SET status = 'approved' WHERE id = '<invoice_id>';
```

## üìà Confidence Score Calculation

The AI confidence score helps users understand data quality:

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0.90-1.00 | Excellent - All fields extracted | Accept as-is |
| 0.70-0.89 | Good - Most fields extracted | Quick review |
| 0.50-0.69 | Fair - Some fields missing | Review carefully |
| 0.00-0.49 | Poor - Many fields missing | Manually enter data |

**Score Calculation:**
- Starts at 1.0 (perfect)
- Deduct for each missing/default field
- Example: Missing vendor (-0.2), missing amount (-0.3) = 0.5 score

---

## üéâ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Implementation Complete** when:
1. AI extracts invoice data from PDF/image
2. Form fields auto-populate
3. User can review/edit before submitting
4. Database saves AI metadata (`ai_parsed`, `ai_confidence`, `ai_raw_response`)
5. Approved invoices update budget allocation automatically
6. Budget tracking dashboard reflects new spending

---

## üìù Next Steps

### For User
1. **Test AI extraction** - Upload a real invoice PDF and verify extraction works
2. **Test budget allocation** - Approve invoice and check budget updates
3. **Test edge cases** - Try poor quality images, missing fields, etc.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **AI confidence threshold** - Auto-flag low-confidence extractions for review
2. **Batch upload** - Upload multiple invoices at once
3. **Invoice preview** - Show PDF preview in modal
4. **OCR fallback** - Use Tesseract OCR if OpenAI fails
5. **Line item matching** - Match line items to budget categories automatically
