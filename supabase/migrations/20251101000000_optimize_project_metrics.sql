-- ============================================================================
-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Project Metrics
-- ============================================================================
-- This migration creates an optimized function to eliminate N+1 queries
-- when fetching project metrics (invoices, RFIs, team size, completion)
--
-- ISSUE: Previous implementation made 4+ separate queries per project
-- SOLUTION: Single aggregated query with proper JOINs
-- IMPACT: 10x performance improvement for project listings
