## Phase 2: Error Detection & Agent Routing ✅

### 2.1 Implement Error Classification ✅
- [x] Created `lib/testing/error-classifier.ts`
- [x] Implemented `classifyError()` with regex patterns
- [x] Classification rules for all error types:
  - Build errors (TypeScript)
  - Database errors (RLS, SQL)
  - Runtime errors (JS exceptions)
  - UI errors (element not found)
  - Network errors (API failures)
  - Timeout errors

**Validation**: ✅ Errors correctly classified and routed

---

### 2.2 Build Agent Router
- [ ] Create `lib/testing/agent-router.ts`
- [ ] Implement `routeError(error): string` mapping to slash commands
- [ ] Implement `deployAgent(command, context)` using SlashCommand tool
- [ ] Create error context builder: `buildErrorContext(testResult)`

**Validation**: Errors are routed to correct agents; agent deployment succeeds.

---

### 2.3 Implement Agent Communication
- [ ] Define agent communication protocol (context format)
- [ ] Create `lib/testing/agent-communicator.ts`
- [ ] Implement `sendToAgent(agent, context)` with SlashCommand invocation

---

### 2.5 Integrate Agent Router into Orchestrator
- [ ] Modify orchestrator to call agent router on test failures
- [ ] Add agent deployment tracking to TodoWrite
- [ ] Update test results to include agents deployed
- [ ] Implement fix verification: retry test after agent completes

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Chrome browser installed (latest stable)
- Node.js 18+ for MCP server
- Local or deployed application instance running
- Test database with seed data

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Phase 1.1-1.4 can be developed in parallel (4 developers)
- Phase 3.1-3.4 can be developed in parallel (visual features independent)
- Phase 4.1-4.3 can be developed in parallel (different report formats)

### Critical Path
```
1.2 (Chrome Client) → 1.5 (Basic Orchestrator) → 2.1 (Error Classification)
→ 2.2 (Agent Router) → 2.5 (Integration) → 3.5 (Feature Tests) → 4.10 (Final Testing)
```

### Risk Mitigation
- **Chrome MCP instability**: Build fallback with Puppeteer as alternative
- **Agent routing accuracy**: Start with manual classification, iterate based on data
- **Test flakiness**: Implement retry logic early; add explicit waits
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize screenshot capture; cache auth state
