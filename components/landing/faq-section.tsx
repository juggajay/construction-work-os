  {
    question: "How long does setup actually take?",
    answer: "Seriously, 15-20 minutes. Create your account, import your project details, invite your team via email, and you&apos;re tracking RFIs same day. No consultants, no training sessions. If you can use email, you can use Construction Work OS.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does offline mode really work, or is it just marketing?",
    answer: "It actually works. We built it for field superintendents in rural areas and basement mechanical rooms. Log daily reports, update RFI status, take photos - all without cell service. Everything syncs automatically when you reconnect. We use the same tech as Google Docs offline mode.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my team isn&apos;t tech-savvy?",
    answer: "That&apos;s why we built 56px glove-friendly buttons and a dead-simple interface. If they can text, they can use this. Plus, unlimited users means everyone can practice without per-seat costs. Our field adoption rate is 95% - higher than any competitor.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from Procore or PlanGrid?",
    answer: "Three ways: (1) We&apos;re 70% cheaper with no per-seat pricing, (2) We&apos;re built BY contractors, not software people trying to understand construction, (3) Offline-first mobile instead of web-app-in-a-wrapper. We&apos;re the tool we wished existed when we ran our $12M electrical contracting business.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I integrate with QuickBooks for billing?",
    answer: "Yes. We support QuickBooks Online and Desktop. Export AIA G702/G703 payment applications directly to QuickBooks with one click. No double data entry, no CSV imports, just works.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about data security? Our projects are confidential.",
    answer: "We&apos;re SOC 2 Type II certified (same as Fortune 500 companies). Data encrypted in transit and at rest. Daily backups with 30-day retention. Role-based access controls so your subs only see their scope. We take security as seriously as you do.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support AIA document formats?",
    answer: "Yes, we support AIA Document Formats including G702/G703 payment applications, and our workflows align with standard AIA contract administration practices. We&apos;re not officially AIA-certified (they don&apos;t certify software), but we follow their formats exactly.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if we need to cancel?",
    answer: "Cancel anytime, no contracts, no penalties. We bill month-to-month per active project. Pause a project and you&apos;re not charged. Your data stays accessible for 90 days after cancellation. We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you&apos;re not saving time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we import our existing project data?",
    answer: "Yes. We support CSV imports for RFIs, submittals, and contacts. Our team can also help with bulk data migration from Procore, PlanGrid, or Excel at no extra charge. Usually takes 1-2 days, not weeks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free trial? Do I need a credit card?",
    answer: "14-day free trial, no credit card required, full feature access. Invite your whole team, test offline mode, try the mobile app. If you&apos;re not convinced after 14 days, no hard feelings. We&apos;re betting you&apos;ll love it.",
